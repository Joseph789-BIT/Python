The current validation processes for academic and financial documents suffer from inefficiencies, delays, and security
vulnerabilities. The proposed platform addresses these challenges by leveraging advanced technologies such as blockchain,
artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) to create a robust and trustworthy validation ecosystem.
This proposal outlines the development of an advanced document validation platform aimed at revolutionizing the
verification process for academic certificates and financial documents. The platform integrates cutting-edge technology
to offer seamless communication between educational institutions, governmental agencies, and students, ensuring
efficiency, accuracy, and security.
